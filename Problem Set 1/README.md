# O meu primeiro projeto do CS50

Primeira vez que estou a usar  o git, estou a experimentar

My Scratch project is a Harry Potter-themed game where you control Harry using the arrow keys. Your goal is to catch the falling stars to earn points while avoiding the lightning bolts, which reduce your lives. However, if you miss a star, you lose 1 point from your score. You start with 3 lives, and the game ends when you lose them all. Press Space to start.
